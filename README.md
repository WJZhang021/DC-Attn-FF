## Design Choices for Attention Mechanism and Feature Fusion in Anomalous Sound Detection

### About this project
This is my undergraduate dissertation project. It is oriented for DCASE2024 contest, so the experiments are not systematic & the methodologies are very phenomenological and inelegant.  
Thus, from the research perspective, I would say this work is sh**. As a result, there will probably not be a public paper about this work (unless you bother to check my dissertation paper~  
I guess if I implement attention visualization, this work may seem more attractive, but I think intellectually it makes no essential difference at all. Besides, I have no time or interest in continuing this project~

### About the code files
The files here are only a proportion of the entire framework (the proportion that I've worked on), so they cannot be run as an end-to-end program.
The whole framework is not open-source yet (up to Nov 27, 2024), and it's not my call. Still, these code files here are the core part, so I upload them for record.  
'inlier_modeling_multibranch.py' is the main script.
